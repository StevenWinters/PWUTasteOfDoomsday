    <h3>Earthquakes Can Be Measured</h3>
    <p>
      Earthquakes can be measured Earthquakes can be measured with a device
      called a seismometer, which detects the seismic waves of the earthquake as
      a series of zig zags, that data is then used to assign magnitude levels to
      the earthquake ranging from 1-10. Magnitude being the size of the waves,
      sometimes also referred to as the amplitude of the waves, generated by the
      earthquake. Intensity is substituted for magnitude at times, but they are
      different.

      <h3>What is Intensity?</h3>
      <p>
        Intensity is the amount of damage the earthquake makes to the
        surrounding area.

    <h3 data-aos="fade-down">A Theory Supporting Another</h3>
    <p data-aos="fade-down-right">
      While earthquakes undoubtedly are a huge effect leading into the
      separation of continents, especially from Alfred Wegener's Continental
      Drift Theory; what really is the reason on what caused earthquakes during
      the times of the Pangea?
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p data-aos="fade-down-left">
      Another theory created and implemented to the infamous continental drift
      is the tectonic plate theory; which tells us that there are divisions of
      the earth's outer shell. This theory supports the continental drift,
      describing that long and destructive earthquakes are caused by the sudden
      shift of the earth's tectonic plates; mainly due to radioactive heat
      coming from the earth's interior. Therefore causing the once
      supercontinent to divide and disperse, along with the tectonic plates into
      smaller ones.
    </p>
    <br />
    <br />
    <p data-aos="fade-up-right">
      There are 3 types of plate boundaries, namely, convergent, divergent, and
      transform boundaries. Transform boundaries cause the most frequent and
      destructive earthquakes due to two plates sliding past each other from the
      sides. But do not misunderstand, with the eruptions from the volcanoes
      that were made by the other two boundaries, they also cause earthquakes
      yet not as strong compared to the transform boundaries.
